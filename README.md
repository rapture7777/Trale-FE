# trAle

This is a hybrid mobile app called trAle, designed to allow users to find nearby ale trails, view them on a map and track their progress along them. It is our final project for Northcoders.

## Getting started

In order to run a desktop version of the app, first clone this repository to a directory in your machine. Run 'npm install' in order to install the required dependencies, and then run 'npm start' in order to run the app in your browser, at the address http://localhost:3000.

## Features

The user can click the TrAles tab to view a list of local trails in Leeds. Clicking one brings the user to the Map tab where the trail is visualised on the screen via Google Maps, with each pub displayed by a marker. The markers can be clicked on for information about the pub, and if the user's geolocation is close enough, the pub can be checked into. On Chrome, you can spoof your geolocation by pressing Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up developer tools, then click the top right three dots, more tools, and sensors.

The user's profile on the profile tab will be updated with the progress of all trails they have begun and also list any trails they have completed. The user can create an account in the profile tab, where they can provide a username and password and receive a verification email.
